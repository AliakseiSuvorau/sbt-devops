# Lab 3

Run this line from the project root to run the app:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```

As a result, both containers will be started successfully (all the data is already hardcoded, which is a bad example, but for a lab it will do)

At the end of deployment we will see the following text reporting a successful build:
```
test-backend   | User was created
test-backend   | 
test-backend   | BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 11s
```
